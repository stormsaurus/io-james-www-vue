## Description

Personal website built in Vue and Vuetify.

Its relatively simplicity makes it a good candidate to periodically rewrite/update using newer technologies in part for learning. It has been through phases of existance as custom javascript, yui, jquery, angular, ionic, and now vue.

It exercises several components of the vue framework such as grids/flex layout, cards, carousels, chips, etc.

It's not licensed for privacy reasons but is available to view as a demonstration of work.
