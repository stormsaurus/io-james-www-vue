                    <p>I am primarily interested in working with a great group of people on compelling and interesting projects.  The particular tech stack or position, while relevant, is not the most important thing to me.  I can get up to speed on most stacks and have performed as needed in many roles.  Recently I have been digging deeper into machine learning and crytocurrency fintech.</p>

                    <p>I started in science and then became fascinated with computer technologies.  Most of my technical computer experience is full stack with a heavy amount of java and javascript.  Various endevours have added experience in machine learning, medical devices/diagnostics, shipping management, geospatial analysis, electromechanical simulations, audio and video streaming, and writing world class APIs.</p><p>Currently I am looking into new languages again like go, exploring improvements in javascript typescript and es6, and digging deeper into machine learning.</p>

                            <p>Development of a model-based design optimization platform for engineers. The software was first used by DARPA for the crowd sourced FANG competition awarding a million dollar prize.  It integrates requirements management, design space exploration, modeling, Modelica simulation, trade space studies, parametric optimization, verification and certification to arrive at better designs faster.  My work centered on architecting and implementing a modular html5 client, defining the services REST API, and guiding ongoing web client work.</p>
                            <p>Accomplishments: We were going to miss features for a key funding deadline due to prior technical decisions before my arrival.  Myself and two other new hires pitched in over the end of year holidays and rebuilt the entire web client and key server components to make that deadline.  This contributed to an eventual successful acquisition by ESI.</p>
