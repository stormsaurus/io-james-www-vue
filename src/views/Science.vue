    	<p>I used to do experimental Physical Chemistry.  It's <a title="xkcd.com" href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png">between</a> physics and chemistry.  Eventually I changed paths and arranged bits instead of molecules.</p>
    	<p>My Ph.D. research was at the University of California Los Angeles, undergraduate research was at University of Florida Gainesville, while also spending some time at L.U.R.E. which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron">synchrotron</a> facility in Orsay, France.  We <a href="/#/publications">published</a> some <a href="/#/dissertation">research</a> about two dimensional monolayers which were subjected to crushing barriers, lasers and particle accelerators.</p>
    	<p>The molecules didn't have a chance.</p>
    	<p>A high power laser microscope images of single molecular layers on water.  If you catch them at just the right conditions they create some fantastic images.</p>
