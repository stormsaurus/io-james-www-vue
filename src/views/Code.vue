            <p>I am a Software Engineer and Architect who loves to work on interesting <a href="/#/projects">projects</a>. I like to be hands-on coding which keeps you in touch with the project. Being able to readily adapt to most technology stacks has given me experience in HTML5, Java, Python, Typescript, Javascript, and others. A long time ago I graduated doing Ph.D. research in experimental Physical Chemistry. These together have given me a unique skillset which has offered powerful ways to see solutions to a problem.</p>

            <p>In software I have hired, managed, client interacted, and developed projects across a variety of domains including machine learning, solar, parametric simulation, world class software apis, medical diagnostics, hybrid mobile apps, audio video streaming, and a few startups of my own. They all generally involved web technology companies. In differing amounts I architected, managed, mentored, and coded whatever was needed when I discovered a project that was just really that cool to be part of. I am equally happy at leading and organizing teams as I am at individually contributing.</p>

            <p>I am a strong proponent of rapidly iterating for success and that your initial decisions on technology and tools are critical. At Sungevity for example, we built several Machine Learning pipelines quickly throwing out the old ones as faster, cheaper, and more accurate solutions became apparent. Recently I have production delivered a mix of a small amount of Golang and large amount of Ionic/hybrid mobile code hosted on Google Cloud using Kubernetes.</p>
